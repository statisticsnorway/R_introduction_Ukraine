## Analysis of Ukrainien data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can write formulas like this: 
$$y_i=a* x_i +e_i$$
You can write bold letters like this: **bold**.




When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r, sum}
summary(employees)
```


You can embed an R code and hide code, warnings and message like this:

```{r read, message = F, echo=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
employees <- read_csv2("./data/employees.csv")
summary(employees)
maximum<- max(employees$year2016)
```


## Include numbers in text

The maximum number of emplyees are `r maximum`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r figure , message = F, echo=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
employees <- read_csv2("./data/employees.csv")
wages <- read_csv2("./data/wages.csv")

employees <- employees %>%
  mutate(level = ifelse(nchar(SIC) == 1, "main", "subdivision"),
         level = ifelse(Industry == "Total", "national", level))

wages <- wages %>%
  rename(wages2017 = year2017)


employees <- left_join(employees, wages, by = c("SIC"="sic"))


employees %>%
  filter(level == "main") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SIC, y = year2017)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Include tables

```{r table, message = F, echo=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)

kable(employees,caption="Employess in Ukraine", digits=0)

```
